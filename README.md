Project Title: 
Pac-Men Exercise

Description of Project:
This project allowed us to practice our html skills by creating a Pac Man type of game. In this game, you can click a button to create a pac man at a random location on the screen. Once you create the Pac Man, it will bounce back and forth due to the bounds of the screen you set up. This allowed us to also play around with velocity concepts / randomizing things in html.

How to Run: 
When you load the game, click the "start game" button and click "add pacman" button each time you want to add another pac man 

Roadmap of future improvements: 
As a next step, i'd like to add other components to the page and potentially add containers to keep the pacman confined to a specific section of the page.
